# Elevens Lab
This lab is the first of the AP Labs that the college board has made for the AP Computer Science course. In this lab I was tasked with creating a program in Java that is able to play the solitare game Elevens. For extra functionality you are also able to play Twelves and Thirteens.

## Background
Elevens is a solitaire card game using a standard 52-card deck. Cards are placed in a 3x3 grid, and pairs of cards which add up to eleven (5 and 6; 4 and 7; 3 and 8; 2 and 9; Ace and 10) are covered up; face cards (J, Q, K) may be eliminated in a set of three cards consisting of one Jack, one Queen and one King regardless of suit. If all cards are covered up the game is won; if there are no more pairs of cards that add up to eleven, and there do not exist a Jack, a Queen, and a King, the game is lost. An individual game of elevens is a game of pure chance, except for the small element of skill involved in spotting the pairs; the skill and strategic interest comes in not shuffling the cards at the end of each game, but instead collecting them up in order.

## Usage
This program has features such as:
> ver1.03 | High score evaluation.

> ver1.02 | Reshuffle function.

> ver1.04 | Winner Popup.

> ver1.05 | Ability to switch gamemodes mid-match, and return at a later time.

## UI Preview
>This UI was designed using modern swing UI elements in mind. With animations in future versions coming.
